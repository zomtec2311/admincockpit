# Admin Cockpit

It had annoyed me for a long time that as an admin of a nextcloud instance you don't reach all available areas centrally summarized, but sometimes have to click right and left, switch from the admin area to the users or apps, etc. My idea was therefore to combine all important administrative areas in one app. This is how the NextCloud app Admincockpit was created. However, it is currently still in a preliminary version that is not intended for productive use and is constantly being further developed.

## ✨ About
