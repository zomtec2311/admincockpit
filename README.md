# Admin Cockpit

It had annoyed me for a long time that as an admin of a nextcloud instance you don't reach all available areas centrally summarized, but sometimes have to click right and left, switch from the admin area to the users or apps, etc. My idea was therefore to combine all important administrative areas in one app. This is how the NextCloud app Admincockpit was created. However, it is currently still in a preliminary version that is not intended for productive use and is constantly being further developed.

## ✨ About

### AdminCockpit is an administration tool for Nextcloud

- ✅ All important administration pages at a glance

## 💡 F.A.Q.

  <summary><b>All of the text is in english?</b></summary>
	Maybe your language files are missing.

  You might want to help translating the app to new languages or report errors in existing translations. So feel free and send me translations.

  <summary><b>Very bad translation?</b></summary>
  We used the AI-based Google translator to generate language files. Of course, there were limitations to the translation depending on the quality of the AI. If you'd like to help improve your language file, open an issue and report your suggestion for improvement. Thank you
